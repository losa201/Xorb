# XORB Cybersecurity Platform - System Overview

## Architecture Summary

The XORB platform is a modern, microservices-based cybersecurity system designed for autonomous threat detection and response. It follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns and dependency inversion.

## Component Breakdown

| Component | Port | Technology | Purpose |
|---------|------|------------|---------|
| API Gateway | 8000 | FastAPI | RESTful API entrypoint with security middleware |
| Orchestrator | 8080 | Temporal | Autonomous workflow execution and task management |
| PostgreSQL | 5434 | PostgreSQL 16 | Core security data storage |
| Redis | 6381 | Redis 7 | Session/state management |
| Temporal | 7233 | Temporal | Workflow orchestration backend |
| Temporal UI | 8081 | Temporal | Workflow monitoring and management |
| Prometheus | 9091 | Prometheus | Metrics collection |
| Grafana | 3001 | Grafana | Monitoring dashboard |

## Data Flows

1. User Interface → API Gateway → Orchestrator → Security Tools
2. Security Tools → Data Layer → Monitoring
3. Orchestrator → Temporal → Workflow Execution
4. Metrics → Prometheus → Grafana

## Security Architecture

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- JWT Authentication
- Request Validation & Sanitization
- Structured Logging
- Secure Communication (HTTPS)

## Deployment Architecture

- Containerized with Docker
- Orchestration via Docker Compose
- Environment separation (development/production)
- Health check endpoints for all services

## AI/ML Components

- Autonomous decision-making in orchestrator
- Threat pattern recognition in detection services
- Adaptive response mechanisms

## Development Principles

- Clean Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design
- Dependency Injection
- Testability
- Separation of Concerns

## Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal scaling via container orchestration
- Load balancing at API gateway
- Caching with Redis
- Asynchronous processing with Temporal

## Monitoring & Observability

- Prometheus metrics for all services
- Structured logging
- Temporal workflow tracking
- Grafana dashboards
- Health check endpoints

## Future Improvements

- Service mesh implementation
- API gateway for unified access
- Enhanced AI/ML capabilities
- Additional security layers
- Improved observability tools
