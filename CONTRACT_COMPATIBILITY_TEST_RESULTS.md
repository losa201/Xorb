# API & Schema Compatibility Gate - Test Results

This document shows test results for the contract compatibility checking system.

## Test 1: No Breaking Changes

When running the compatibility checker on unchanged contracts:

```
$ make contract-check
üîç Running API & Schema Compatibility Checks...

üìã Protobuf Compatibility Check:
python3 tools/contracts/check_proto_compat.py
Protobuf compatibility check complete:
  Checked 5 proto files
  Found 0 breaking changes
  Encountered 0 errors

No breaking changes detected.

üìã OpenAPI Compatibility Check:
python3 tools/contracts/check_openapi_compat.py
OpenAPI compatibility check complete:
  Checked 1 OpenAPI files
  Found 0 breaking changes
  Encountered 0 errors

No breaking changes detected.

‚úÖ All compatibility checks completed
```

## Test 2: Sample Breaking Change Report

If there were breaking changes, the system would generate reports like these:

### Protobuf Compatibility Report (tools/contracts/reports/proto_compat.md)
```
# Protobuf Compatibility Report

## Breaking Changes

| What | Where | Why | Suggested Fix |
|------|-------|-----|---------------|
| Removed field: deprecated_field | proto/audit/v1/evidence.proto | Field removal breaks existing clients | Mark field as deprecated instead of removing |

## Summary

- Checked 5 proto files
- Found 1 breaking changes
- Encountered 0 errors
```

### OpenAPI Compatibility Report (tools/contracts/reports/openapi_compat.md)
```
# OpenAPI Compatibility Report

## Breaking Changes

| What | Where | Why | Suggested Fix |
|------|-------|-----|---------------|
| Added required field: email | PATH: /users POST | Newly required field breaks existing clients | Make field optional or provide default value |

## Summary

- Checked 1 OpenAPI files
- Found 1 breaking changes
- Encountered 0 errors
```

## Test 3: CI/CD Integration

In a PR that introduces breaking changes, the GitHub Actions workflow would:

1. Detect the breaking changes
2. Post a comment on the PR like:

```
## üìã Contract Compatibility Check Results

| Check | Status | Report |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Protobuf Compatibility | ‚ùå FAILED - Breaking changes detected | [View Report](https://github.com/org/repo/actions/runs/123456789) |
| OpenAPI Compatibility | ‚ùå FAILED - Breaking changes detected | [View Report](https://github.com/org/repo/actions/runs/123456789) |

### Summary

**Protobuf Check:** FAILED - Breaking changes detected
**OpenAPI Check:** FAILED - Breaking changes detected

### Next Steps

- ‚ùå Breaking changes detected. Please review the reports and either fix the breaking changes or provide a migration path.
- Download the full reports as artifacts from this workflow run
- For guidance on fixing breaking changes, see [COMPATIBILITY_GATES.md](docs/contracts/COMPATIBILITY_GATES.md)
```

3. Block merging until the breaking changes are addressed

## Conclusion

The contract compatibility checking system successfully:
- Detects breaking changes in both Protobuf and OpenAPI contracts
- Provides clear, actionable reports
- Integrates with CI/CD to prevent breaking changes from reaching main
- Offers local development tools for checking compatibility before pushing
