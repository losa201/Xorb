###  **2. Red Team / Blue Team Integration**
```
Red Team (PTaaS)                    Blue Team (XORB Core)
─────────────────                    ──────────────────────
Attack Simulation      ──────▶       Defense Response

##  Advanced Integration Features

###  **Shared Threat Intelligence Database**
```python
# Example: Unified threat model
class UnifiedThreatModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.attack_vectors = PTaaSDiscovery()     # From PTaaS
        self.defensive_measures = XORBDefenses()   # From XORB
        self.threat_correlation = ThreatIntel()    # Shared analysis

    def continuous_validation(self):
        """Continuous red/blue team validation"""
        vulnerabilities = self.attack_vectors.discover()
        defenses = self.defensive_measures.generate(vulnerabilities)
        effectiveness = self.attack_vectors.test_defenses(defenses)
        return self.optimize_security_posture(effectiveness)
