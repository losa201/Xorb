# API & Schema Compatibility Gate Implementation Summary

## Overview
This PR implements an automated compatibility checking system for XORB's public contracts to prevent breaking changes to:
1. Protobuf (.proto) messages and services
2. OpenAPI specifications

## Components Implemented

### 1. Tools (`tools/contracts/`)
- `check_proto_compat.py` - Protobuf compatibility checker
- `check_openapi_compat.py` - OpenAPI compatibility checker
- `_utils.py` - Shared utilities for git operations, file handling, and report generation

### 2. Makefile Targets
- `make contract-check` - Runs both compatibility checks
- `make contract-report` - Displays latest compatibility reports
- `make install-contract-deps` - Installs required dependencies (buf, protoc, pyyaml)

### 3. CI/CD Integration (`.github/workflows/contract-compat.yml`)
- Runs on PRs to main branch that modify contract files
- Posts summary comment on PR with results
- Uploads detailed reports as artifacts
- Blocks merge if breaking changes detected

### 4. Documentation (`docs/contracts/COMPATIBILITY_GATES.md`)
- Defines what constitutes breaking changes
- Provides guidance on fixing breaking changes
- Explains how to run checks locally
- Documents CI/CD integration

### 5. Sample Reports
- `tools/contracts/reports/proto_compat.json` - JSON format report
- `tools/contracts/reports/proto_compat.md` - Human-readable Markdown report
- `tools/contracts/reports/openapi_compat.json` - JSON format report
- `tools/contracts/reports/openapi_compat.md` - Human-readable Markdown report

## Features

### Breaking Change Detection
- **Protobuf**: Field removal/renaming, type changes, required/optional flips, service signature changes
- **OpenAPI**: Endpoint removal, response schema narrowing, required field additions, enum narrowing

### Reporting
- Clear Markdown tables showing WHAT changed, WHERE, WHY it's breaking, and SUGGESTED FIX
- JSON reports for programmatic consumption
- Human-readable summaries

### Local Development
- Easy-to-use Makefile targets
- Pre-commit hook to warn about contract changes
- Dependency installation script

### CI/CD Integration
- Automatic checking on relevant PRs
- PR comment summaries with status indicators
- Artifact upload for detailed analysis
- Merge blocking on breaking changes

## Usage

### Local Development
1. Run `make contract-check` to check for breaking changes
2. Run `make contract-report` to view reports
3. Run `make install-contract-deps` to install dependencies

### CI/CD
- Automatically runs on PRs that modify contract files
- Results visible in PR comments and workflow artifacts

## Future Enhancements
- JSON schema export for key responses
- Validation of example fixtures in tests/contracts/*
- Enhanced pre-commit hook with actual compatibility checking
