# Cognitive Agent

##  Overview
The CognitiveAgent serves as the analytical core of the swarm, responsible for:
- Threat pattern recognition
- Behavioral analysis of system anomalies
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Adaptive learning from swarm telemetry

##  Responsibilities
1. **Threat Analysis** - Processes alerts from SecurityAnalystAgents
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifies attack patterns using ML models
3. **Decision Engine** - Prioritizes responses based on risk assessment
4. **Knowledge Sharing** - Distributes threat intelligence to ResponseAgents

##  Communication Protocol
```python
class CognitiveAgent:
    def analyze_threat(self, alert_data):
        # Process alert with ML models
        risk_score = self._calculate_risk(alert_data)
        if risk_score > THRESHOLD:
            self._trigger_response_plan(alert_data)

    def _calculate_risk(self, data):
        # ML-powered risk assessment
        return risk_model.predict(data)
```text

##  Trust Model Integration
- Updates trust scores based on analysis accuracy
- Flags suspicious patterns in agent behavior
- Participates in decentralized voting for critical decisions

##  Telemetry Integration
Pushes metrics to Prometheus endpoint at http://localhost:9090
Tracks: analysis_latency, threat_detection_rate, false_positive_rate

##  Visualization
Integrated with Grafana dashboard: agent_states, decision_heatmaps

##  Next Steps
- Implement reinforcement learning for adaptive pattern recognition
- Enhance anomaly detection with unsupervised learning
- Optimize decision engine for real-time response scenarios
