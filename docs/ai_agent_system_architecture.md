##  Component Details

###  Main XORB API (Port 8000)
- Primary entry point for the platform
- Handles authentication and basic routing
- Will be updated to route requests to the Agent Coordinator and Orchestrator Service

###  Agent Coordinator (Port 8001)
- Manages communication between specialized AI agents
- Provides a unified interface for threat analysis and intelligence
- Implements REST API for agent capabilities

###  Orchestrator Service (Port 8005 - proposed)
- Coordinates between intelligence and execution components
- Manages complex security workflows
- Implements REST API for workflow management

###  Specialized AI Agents
- **ThreatHuntingAgent**: Proactive threat hunting with ML-based pattern recognition
- **BehavioralAnalysisAgent**: Sophisticated anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- **IncidentResponseAgent**: Coordinated incident response workflows
- **AttackPredictionAgent**: Threat intelligence integration for attack prediction
- **ComplianceMonitoringAgent**: Regulatory compliance monitoring

###  Execution Engine (Port 8002)
- Security scanning and assessment capabilities
- Will be integrated with the orchestrator for automated response

##  Integration Plan

###  Phase 1: API Integration
1. Update main XORB API to route requests to Agent Coordinator and Orchestrator Service
2. Implement service discovery for component communication
3. Add authentication/authorization for inter-service communication

###  Phase 2: Workflow Integration
1. Define standard workflows for common security scenarios
2. Implement workflow execution in the Orchestrator Service
3. Connect AI agent outputs to Execution Engine capabilities

###  Phase 3: UI Integration
1. Add visualizations for AI agent outputs
2. Implement workflow status tracking in the UI
3. Add control interfaces for workflow management

##  Security Considerations
- All inter-service communication should use mTLS
- Implement rate limiting and request validation
- Ensure proper authentication for all API endpoints
- Maintain comprehensive audit logging

##  Future Enhancements
- Add machine learning model persistence
- Implement model retraining workflows
- Add additional specialized agents for new capabilities
- Enhance the orchestrator with adaptive workflow capabilities

##  Conclusion

The implemented AI agent system provides a strong foundation for advanced cybersecurity capabilities in the Xorb platform. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and integration with existing components.
