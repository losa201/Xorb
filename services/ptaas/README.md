# PTAAS Service

This service implements the real-world PTAAS (Penetration Testing as a Service) functionality for the XORB platform.

##  Architecture
The PTAAS service follows a modular architecture with the following components:
- Core service management
- Vulnerability scanning
- Attack simulation
- Threat intelligence correlation
- Reporting engine

##  Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the service
python -m ptaas_service.core.main
```

##  Configuration
The service uses environment variables for configuration, which can be set in the `.env` file:
```env
PTAAS_PORT=8000
PTAAS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
THREAT_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

##  Components
###  Core Service
Manages service initialization, configuration loading, and component orchestration.

###  Vulnerability Scanner
Integrates with industry-standard tools (Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS) for comprehensive vulnerability detection.

###  Attack Simulator
Simulates real-world attack patterns with safety controls to prevent actual damage.

###  Threat Intelligence Correlation
Integrates with threat intelligence platforms to contextualize findings.

###  Reporting Engine
Generates comprehensive penetration testing reports with remediation guidance.
