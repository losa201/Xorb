#  Orchestrator Service

The Orchestrator Service is the core component of the XORB platform responsible for autonomous workflow execution and task coordination.

##  Overview

This service provides:
- Autonomous task orchestration using Temporal
- Integration with security tools and detection systems
- Dynamic response planning and execution
- Workflow persistence and state management

##  Architecture

The orchestrator follows a layered architecture pattern:

```
orchestrator/
├── workflows/        # Temporal workflow definitions
├── activities/       # Task implementation units
├── models/           # Workflow and task data models
├── services/         # Business logic and domain services
├── infrastructure/   # External system integrations
└── config/           # Configuration and settings
```

##  Key Features

- **Temporal Integration**: Uses Temporal for workflow management and state persistence
- **Autonomous Execution**: Self-coordinating task execution with failure recovery
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Adaptable response plans based on threat intelligence
- **Security Integration**: Connects to detection systems and response mechanisms

##  Configuration

The service requires the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| TEMPORAL_HOST | Temporal server address | localhost:7233 |
| LOG_LEVEL | Logging level (INFO, DEBUG, etc.) | INFO |
| MAX_PARALLEL_WORKFLOWS | Maximum concurrent workflows | 10 |

##  Usage

###  Starting the Service

```bash
python main.py
```

###  Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t xorb-orchestrator .
docker run xorb-orchestrator
```

##  Development

###  Adding New Workflows

1. Create a new workflow class in `workflows/`
2. Define the workflow logic using Temporal's workflow decorators
3. Create corresponding activities in `activities/`
4. Update service layer to handle workflow initiation

###  Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

##  Integration Points

The orchestrator integrates with:
- API Service (for command initiation)
- Temporal Server (for workflow management)
- Security tools (for actual response execution)
- Redis (for state caching)

##  Monitoring

The service exposes metrics at `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping.

##  Contributing

1. Follow Temporal best practices
2. Maintain clear separation between workflows and activities
3. Write comprehensive tests for new workflows
4. Document workflow logic and decision points
