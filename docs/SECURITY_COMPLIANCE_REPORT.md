- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support
- OAuth2 integration for third-party identity providers
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for multi-tenancy
- Session management with idle timeout and absolute expiration

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest using AES-256 for PostgreSQL
- Encryption in-transit using TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Data anonymization workflows for GDPR compliance
- Secure secret management using Docker secrets and encrypted storage
- Audit logging of all user actions and system events

### Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms
- Secure container configurations with read-only filesystems
- No-new-privileges security option for all containers
- Regular security scanning in CI/CD pipeline (SAST/DAST)
