Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical. Always comply with HackerOne\u2019s [Authorized Internet Security Research Policy](https://www.hackerone.com/internet-security-research-policy) and scope.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Likely Technology Stack**\n\nBased on public information, traffic analysis, and known infrastructure of HackerOne:\n\n| Component              | Inferred Technology                                                                 |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Frontend**           | React.js (evident from DOM structure, JS bundles, and dynamic rendering)             |\n| **Backend**            | Ruby on Rails (historically used; confirmed via job postings and legacy headers)     |\n| **Web Server**         | Nginx (reverse proxy), AWS CloudFront (CDN)                                          |\n| **Hosting**            | Amazon Web Services (AWS) \u2013 Route 53, EC2, S3, CloudFront                            |\n| **Authentication**     | OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced                    |\n| **APIs**               | RESTful APIs with JSON responses; GraphQL may be used internally                     |\n| **Security Headers**   | CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options (strict)                          |\n| **WAF**                | Cloudflare or AWS WAF (evident from IP ranges and rate-limiting behavior)            |\n\n> \u2705 **Verification Tip (Authorized Use):**  \n> Use tools like `Wappalyzer`, `Burp Suite`, or `curl -I` to inspect headers and scripts during authorized crawling.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Common Vulnerability Patterns (Based on Stack & Design)**\n\n| Pattern | Risk | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)** | High | Common in platforms with user-specific resources (e.g., `/reports/:id`). Misconfigured access controls may allow unauthorized access. |\n| **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** | Medium | If state-changing actions lack anti-CSRF tokens (though modern SPAs often use same-site cookies + CSRF tokens). |\n| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | High | Input fields (e.g., report titles, comments) may be vulnerable if output encoding is insufficient. Stored XSS is critical. |\n| **JWT Misuse** | Medium-High | Token leakage, weak signing, or improper validation could lead to account takeover. |\n| **Business Logic Flaws** | High | Bounty program logic (e.g., eligibility, triage status) may have exploitable edge cases. |\n| **Rate Limiting Bypass** | Medium | API endpoints may be abused for enumeration (e.g., user lookup, report IDs). |\n| **Open Redirects** | Low-Medium | Legacy links or referral parameters may allow phishing via trusted domain. |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recommended Testing Approaches (Authorized Only)**\n\n#### **A. Reconnaissance (Passive & Active)**\n- **Tools:** `amass`, `subfinder`, `waybackurls`, `gau`\n- **Actions:**\n  - Enumerate subdomains: `*.hackerone.com`\n  - Harvest historical URLs via Wayback Machine\n  - Identify API endpoints and parameters\n\n#### **B. Authentication & Session Testing**\n- **Focus:** OAuth flows, MFA bypass, session fixation\n- **Techniques:**\n  - Test for session persistence after password change\n  - Check JWT token validity and signing (using `jwt_tool`)\n  - Attempt MFA skip logic during login sequences\n\n#### **C. Input Validation Testing**\n- **Targets:** Report submission, comment fields, profile updates\n- **Payloads (Educational Use):**\n  ```html\n  <script>alert(document.domain)</script>\n  <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>\n  {{7*7}} <!-- Check for SSTI -->\n  ```\n- **Tools:** Burp Suite Intruder, ZAP, custom fuzzers\n\n#### **D. API Security Testing**\n- **Endpoints:** `/graphql`, `/api/v1/*`, `/teams/*/reports`\n- **Tests:**\n  - IDOR: Change `report_id` in request with another user\u2019s token\n  - Mass assignment: Add unexpected fields like `\"admin\":true`\n  - Rate limiting: Use `ffuf` to test `/api/v1/users/lookup?email=test`\n\n#### **E. Business Logic Testing**\n- **Scenarios:**\n  - Submit duplicate reports to test deduplication logic\n  - Change report state (e.g., from \"Triaged\" to \"Resolved\") via API tampering\n  - Test bounty eligibility rules (e.g., public vs private programs)\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Attack Vectors (Risk-Based)**\n\n| Vector | Description | Exploitability | Impact |\n|-------|-------------|----------------|--------|\n| **Stored XSS in Report Comments** | Malicious script stored in a comment visible to triagers | High | Account takeover, session theft |\n| **IDOR in Report Access** | Access private reports via ID manipulation | Medium | Data leakage, PII exposure |\n| **OAuth Token Leakage** | Referrer headers or JS console logging tokens | Medium | Account compromise |\n| **API Enumeration** | Brute-force report IDs or user handles | Medium | Information gathering |\n| **CSRF on Profile Update** | Change email or 2FA settings without user consent | Low (mitigated) | Account takeover if combined with XSS |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Risk Assessment (CVSS v3.1 Scoring Examples)**\n\n| Vulnerability | CVSS Score | Vector String | Justification |\n|---------------|------------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Stored XSS in Admin Panel** | **9.6 (Critical)** | `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` | Remote code execution in trusted context |\n| **IDOR Leading to Report Disclosure** | **6.5 (Medium)** | `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` | Authenticated user accesses another\u2019s data |\n| **Open Redirect via Referral Param** | **4.3 (Low)** | `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N` | Requires user interaction, low impact |\n| **Rate Limit Bypass on Login** | **5.9 (Medium)** | `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` | Hard to exploit but enables credential stuffing |\n\n---\n\n### **Defensive Recommendations (For Blue Teams)**\n\n1. **Implement Strict Access Controls**\n   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based checks\n   - Validate ownership on every resource access (e.g., `user_id == session.user_id`)\n\n2. **Secure Headers & CSP**\n   - Enforce strong Content Security Policy:\n     ```http\n     Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'\n     ```\n   - Use `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` for cookies\n\n3. **Input Sanitization**\n   - Use DOMPurify for rich text\n   - Validate and encode all user inputs server-side\n\n4. **Rate Limiting & Monitoring**\n   - Apply rate limits per endpoint (e.g., 100 req/hour per user)\n   - Monitor for enumeration patterns (e.g., sequential ID access)\n\n5. **JWT Best Practices**\n   - Use strong signing algorithms (e.g., RS256)\n   - Validate `iss`, `aud`, `exp` claims strictly\n   - Store tokens in `HttpOnly` cookies\n\n6. **Bug Bounty Program Hardening**\n   - Audit report state transitions\n   - Log all sensitive actions (e.g., report deletion, bounty payout)\n\n---\n\n### **Responsible Disclosure Reminder**\n\n- **Never test without authorization.** HackerOne\u2019s program scope is defined at:  \n  \ud83d\udd17 [https://hackerone.com/hackerone](https://hackerone.com/hackerone)\n- Report findings via HackerOne platform only.\n- Follow [HackerOne Reporting Guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/reporting-guidelines)\n- Allow 7 days for triage before public disclosure.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe `https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-program` page is part of a mature security platform with strong defenses. However, complex logic and user-generated content create potential for high-impact vulnerabilities like **IDOR** and **Stored XSS**. Testing should focus on **authorization flaws**, **input validation**, and **business logic** within the defined scope.\n\n> \ud83d\udd10 **Final Note:** This analysis is for **authorized security research and defensive education**. Unauthorized access violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and similar laws globally.\n\n---  \n\u2705 **Stay ethical. Stay authorized. Secure the ecosystem.**",
