## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Service Orchestrator Capabilities
```python
# Service Registry with 11 Managed Services
- database (core) → cache (core) → vector_store (core)
- behavioral_analytics (analytics) ← depends on [database, cache]
- threat_hunting (security) ← depends on [database]
- forensics (security) ← depends on [database]
- network_microsegmentation (security) ← depends on [database]
- threat_intelligence (intelligence) ← depends on [database, vector_store]
```
