- **False positive rate**: Target <5% (current: 12%)
- **Residual risk score**: Target â†“40% (tracking)
- **Replay pass-rate**: Target â‰¥95% (current: 78%)

### Business Metrics
- **MTTR/MTTC**: Mean time to recovery/containment
- **Time-to-patch**: From PR creation to deployment
- **SLA adherence**: Uptime during attack simulations
- **Zero-day findings**: Target â‰¥3/month from fuzzing

## Integration with NVIDIA MoE

### Orchestrator Brain
- **NVIDIA Qwen3-235b-a22b**: Executive planning and audit
- **Specialist models**: Coder (diffs/tests), Generalist (verification)
- **Bandit routing**: Dynamic model selection by role/interest
- **Verifier gates**: All PR blueprints require verification

### AI Safety Architecture
- **Safety Critic**: Real-time action monitoring
- **Verifier chains**: Multi-model consensus for critical decisions
- **Rollback mechanisms**: Automatic policy reversion on KPI breach
- **Human oversight**: Escalation paths for edge cases

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Overfitting to Purple**: Mitigation via weekly stack rotation
- **Cost creep**: Episode budgets with warm-pool optimization
- **Signal dilution**: Strict schemas with novelty penalties

### Operational Risks
- **Context sprawl**: Data contracts with schema linting
- **Model drift**: Continuous validation with benchmark suites
- **Security exposure**: Sandboxed execution with network isolation
