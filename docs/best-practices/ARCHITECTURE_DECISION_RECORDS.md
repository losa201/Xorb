Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for complex business operations.

###  Rationale
- **Performance**: Separate read/write models optimize for different use cases
- **Scalability**: Read and write sides can scale independently
- **Complexity Management**: Clear separation of commands and queries
- **Event Sourcing**: Foundation for event-driven architecture

###  Consequences
- **Positive**: Better performance, clear operation separation
- **Negative**: Additional complexity, potential data consistency challenges
- **Mitigation**: Careful design of command/query boundaries

###  Decision
Apply Domain-Driven Design principles with bounded contexts and aggregate roots.

###  Rationale
- **Domain Clarity**: Clear modeling of cybersecurity concepts
- **Team Communication**: Ubiquitous language improves collaboration
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear service boundaries for microservices
- **Business Alignment**: Code structure reflects business requirements

###  Consequences
- **Positive**: Better domain understanding, clearer service boundaries
- **Negative**: Requires domain expertise, more complex modeling
- **Mitigation**: Regular domain expert consultation, documentation

##  ADR-004: Microservices Architecture

**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for independent service deployment and scaling

###  Decision
Decompose monolith into focused microservices based on business capabilities.

###  Rationale
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of services
- **Deployment**: Independent deployment reduces risk
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on services

###  Consequences
- **Positive**: Better scalability, deployment flexibility, team autonomy
- **Negative**: Distributed system complexity, network overhead
- **Mitigation**: Service mesh, comprehensive monitoring, API contracts

##  ADR-005: Event-Driven Architecture

**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for loose coupling and real-time capabilities

###  Decision
Implement event-driven architecture with domain events and message queues.

###  Rationale
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through events
- **Real-time**: Event streaming for real-time threat detection
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing improves performance
- **Resilience**: Better failure handling through event replay

###  Consequences
- **Positive**: Loose coupling, better scalability, real-time capabilities
- **Negative**: Eventual consistency, debugging complexity
- **Mitigation**: Event versioning, comprehensive logging, monitoring

##  ADR-006: Security-First Design

**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Cybersecurity platform requires maximum security

###  Decision
Implement security-first design with zero-trust principles.

###  Rationale
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements
- **Threat Modeling**: Proactive security analysis

###  Consequences
- **Positive**: Maximum security, compliance readiness
- **Negative**: Additional complexity, performance overhead
- **Mitigation**: Security automation, performance optimization

##  ADR-007: Container-First Deployment

**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for consistent deployment across environments

###  Decision
Use container-first deployment with Kubernetes orchestration.

###  Rationale
- **Consistency**: Same container runs everywhere
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes provides auto-scaling
- **Portability**: Deploy on any Kubernetes cluster
- **DevOps**: Streamlined CI/CD pipeline

###  Consequences
- **Positive**: Deployment consistency, better scalability
- **Negative**: Container orchestration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Helm charts, monitoring, training

##  ADR-008: API-First Development

**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for service integration and third-party access

###  Decision
Design APIs first using OpenAPI specification before implementation.

###  Rationale
- **Contract-First**: Clear service contracts
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation
- **Testing**: Contract testing and mocking
- **Integration**: Easier third-party integration

###  Consequences
- **Positive**: Better API design, clear contracts, easier integration
- **Negative**: Additional design overhead
- **Mitigation**: API design tools, templates, guidelines

**Context**: Complex distributed system requires comprehensive monitoring

###  Decision
Implement comprehensive observability with metrics, logs, and traces.

###  Rationale
- **Visibility**: Full system visibility
- **Debugging**: Easier troubleshooting
- **Performance**: Performance monitoring and optimization
- **Reliability**: Proactive issue detection

###  Consequences
- **Positive**: Better system visibility, easier debugging
- **Negative**: Additional infrastructure overhead
