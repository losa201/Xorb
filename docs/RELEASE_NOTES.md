### 🔧 Developer Workflow

#### Quick Commands
```bash
# Environment setup
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.lock

# PTaaS development
make ptaas-quickstart     # Start NATS + API
make ptaas-e2e           # Run E2E tests
make ptaas-stop          # Stop services

# Operations
make ops-runbooks        # Access runbooks
make ops-alerts-validate # Validate monitoring
make health              # Service health check

# Security & Quality
make security-full       # Complete security scan
make sbom               # Generate SBOM
make doctor             # Repository health
```

#### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Comprehensive pipeline with 7 validation jobs
- **Pre-commit**: Local validation before commit
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E, and security tests
- **Artifact Generation**: Coverage reports, security scans, SBOMs
