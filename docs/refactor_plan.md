# Xorb Refactor Plan

## 1. Performance Optimizations
- Replace manual NumPy neural network with PyTorch implementation
- Convert threat context API calls to async with aiohttp
- Implement prioritized experience replay buffer

## 2. Architectural Cleanup
- Split ContextAwareAgent into:
  - AgentCore (decision making)
  - ThreatIntelService (external integrations)
  - MetricsCollector (Prometheus integration)
- Replace manual RL implementation with Stable-Baselines3

## 3. Security Enhancements
- Move threat intel URL to environment variables
- Add input validation for state arrays
- Implement request timeouts for API calls

## 4. Testing & Documentation
- Add pytest tests with 85%+ coverage
- Create architecture diagram
- Update README with setup instructions
- Add docstrings and type hints

## 5. CI Pipeline
- Update GitHub Actions workflow to include:
  - Linting (ruff, ESLint)
  - Tests with coverage
  - Security scan (bandit)
  - Type checking (mypy)

Next steps: Implement each component with targeted code changes.
