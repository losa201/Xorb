# Xorb PTaaS Platform Architecture

## Overview
![Xorb PTaaS Architecture](architecture-diagram.png)

## Component Layers

### 1. Ingestion Layer (Scan Orchestration)
**Responsibilities:**
- Receive scan requests
- Validate and queue scans
- Coordinate scanning engine
- Manage scan lifecycle

**Tech Stack:**
- RabbitMQ/Kafka for message queuing
- Redis for scan state management
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Prometheus for monitoring

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes replicas
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Redis cluster for distributed state

### 2. Scanning Engine
**Responsibilities:**
- Execute vulnerability scans
- Run network probes
- Collect raw security data
- Enforce scan policies

**Tech Stack:**
- Go-based microservice
- Nuclei for vulnerability scanning
- Masscan for network discovery
- Custom containerized scanner agents

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Dynamic worker pools based on load
- Isolated scan execution environments
- Rate-limiting and throttling

### 3. AI Analysis Pipeline
**Responsibilities:**
- Process raw scan data
- Run ML models for vulnerability detection
- Correlate findings
- Generate risk scores
- Provide remediation recommendations

**Tech Stack:**
- Python ML stack (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- Scikit-learn for traditional ML
- Pandas for data processing
- ONNX for model serving

**Scaling Strategy:**
- GPU-accelerated inference nodes
- Batch processing pipelines
- Model server with auto-scaling

### 4. Reporting & Dashboard
**Responsibilities:**
- Present findings in UI
- Generate PDF reports
- Track remediation progress
- Provide executive summaries

**Tech Stack:**
- React/Next.js for frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js/D3.js for visualizations
- Puppeteer for PDF generation

**Scaling Strategy:**
- CDN for static assets
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Web workers for client-side processing

### 5. Integrations Layer
**Responsibilities:**
- Connect to SIEMs (Splunk, QRadar)
- Integrate with ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow)
- Provide API for custom integrations
- Handle webhooks and notifications

**Tech Stack:**
- Node.js/Express for API gateway
- OpenAPI/Swagger for API docs
- OAuth2 for authentication
- Webhooks endpoint

**Scaling Strategy:**
- API gateway with rate limiting
- Modular integration plugins
- Async processing for heavy integrations

### 6. Storage Layer
**Responsibilities:**
- Store scan results
- Manage scan history
- Handle large payloads
- Ensure data retention policies

**Tech Stack:**
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- ClickHouse for analytics
- MinIO/S3 for object storage
- Redis for caching

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Read replicas for databases
- Sharding for large datasets
- Cold storage for archival

### 7. Infrastructure
**Responsibilities:**
- Manage cloud resources
- Handle networking and security
- Provide monitoring and logging
- Ensure compliance and auditability

**Tech Stack:**
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Terraform for IaC
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
- ELK stack for logging

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Auto-scaling groups for worker nodes
- Multi-AZ deployment for HA
- Global load balancing for web traffic

## Data Flow
1. User submits scan request via UI/API
2. Ingestion layer validates and queues the scan
3. Scanning engine executes vulnerability checks
4. Raw results are stored and forwarded to AI pipeline
5. ML models analyze findings and generate risk scores
6. Results are stored and made available via UI/API
7. Integrations layer notifies connected systems

## Security Considerations
- All communication encrypted (TLS 1.3)
- Strict input validation
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging of all actions
- Secrets management (Vault)
- Regular security assessments

## Compliance
- ISO 27001 certified infrastructure
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Regular third-party audits
- Detailed audit trails

## Observability
- Centralized logging (ELK)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Alerting (Alertmanager)
- Dashboarding (Grafana)
