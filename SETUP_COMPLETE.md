- **SQLite** database for knowledge storage
- **All Python dependencies** installed

### ✅ HackerOne Integration
- **Web scraper** successfully collecting bug bounty opportunities
- **API client** ready for authenticated operations
- **Program discovery** and target validation
- **Automated report submission** capabilities

### ✅ Security Testing Framework
- **Multi-engine agents** (Playwright, ZAP, Nuclei ready)
- **Knowledge fabric** for storing findings
- **Report generation** with professional formats
- **Campaign management** and orchestration

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Basic System Test
```bash
# Activate environment and run basic test
source venv/bin/activate
python start_xorb_simple.py
```

### 2. HackerOne Opportunities Scraping
```bash
# Scrape current bug bounty opportunities
source venv/bin/activate
python test_hackerone_scraper.py
```

### 3. Full System (requires fixing imports)
```bash
# Run full XORB system
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py --mode development --security development --demo
```

## Current Capabilities

- **Bounty range analysis** and ROI calculation
- **Program prioritization** based on success probability

### 🤖 Automated Security Testing
- **Web application scanning** with Playwright
- **Vulnerability detection** and classification
- **Evidence collection** and proof-of-concept generation
- **CVSS scoring** and impact assessment

### 📊 Professional Reporting
- **Executive summaries** and technical details
- **Multiple formats** (Markdown, JSON, HTML, PDF)
- **Evidence management** and chain of custody
- **Compliance reporting** (SOX, PCI, ISO 27001)

### 🛡️ Security & Compliance
- **Rules of engagement** enforcement
- **Rate limiting** and respectful testing
- **Audit logging** with cryptographic integrity
- **Access control** and permission management

## Configuration

### HackerOne API Integration
To enable full HackerOne functionality:

1. Get API credentials from HackerOne settings
2. Update `config.json`:
```json
{
    "hackerone_api_key": "your_api_key_here",
    "openrouter_api_key": "your_openrouter_key_here"
}
```

### Security Settings
Current configuration in `config.json`:
- **Security Level**: Development (safe for testing)
- **Deployment Mode**: Development
- **Enhanced Features**: ML, Threat Intel, Stealth Agents enabled

## Next Steps

### For Bug Bounty Hunting
1. **Configure targets**: Add authorized domains to test
2. **Set up scopes**: Define what's allowed to test
3. **Get API keys**: HackerOne and OpenRouter for full functionality
4. **Run campaigns**: Start automated vulnerability discovery

### For Red Team Operations  
1. **Define ROE**: Set rules of engagement
2. **Configure agents**: Set up ZAP, Nuclei, custom tools
3. **Plan campaigns**: Create systematic testing approach
4. **Monitor progress**: Use dashboard for real-time tracking

### For Security Research
1. **Knowledge base**: Build custom vulnerability database
2. **ML training**: Train models on your findings
3. **Threat intel**: Connect external threat feeds
4. **Research automation**: Automate repetitive tasks
